                <p>
                  This is the capstone project for my Information Systems major, and is definitely the project that I am most proud of.
                  Taking the role of product manager, I successfully led a team of 6 to design and develop a whole online banking system in three months.
                  The project simulates the real-world business scenario by asking the team to design, implement and deliver the whole system in a few phases to our client - Merlion Bank.
                  We managed to deliver the whole system at the end, covering nine subsystems, including account management, card management, loan management, wealth management, etc.
                  Such a huge project! We were extremely excited that we finally achieved a band-one grade and satisfied our client.
                  <br>
                  PS: I am only showing a small part of the project to demonstrate the process.

                    Singapore is widely recognized as one of the four leading global financial hubs in Asia.
                    Both overseas and local financial institutions base their headquarters in Singapore to better cater to their regional group activities, making Singapore a promosing yet highly competitive market.
                    Against this backdrop, the global investment advisory panel of Merlion Investment Holding had advised Merlion to consider building a top-notch direct bank in Singapore, which aims to fully digitalize its banking service.
                    Emphasizing strongly on retail banking system which incorporates Business Intelligence (BI) and analytical Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, Merlion Bank visions to reward customers with higher interest rates by mitigating cost on brick-and-mortar branches.

                    <strong>Merlion Bank</strong>: Both the system provider and the system user. Staff need to use the system to support their direct banking services.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Merlion Bank Customers</strong>: The main users of the system. Users would enjoy most of their banking services through the system.

                  <p>
                    <strong>External Parties</strong>: The system should have the ability to communicate with external parties such as other banks and financial institutions to perform transactions, clearing and settlement, etc.

                    Understanding the organizational structure of Merlion Bank is essential for us to design the structure of the banking system. The actual structure is much more complicated, so we only extracted information useful in the scope of this project.

                    After knowing the organizational structure of Merlion Bank and also the needs of our client, we defined the scope of our project. The system will include nine subsystems providing different essential services to both bank staff and customers.

                  <p class="mt40">
                    There will be three modules of the system:
                    <h5 class="project-point">Teller's counter system</h5>
                    Internal system supporting Merlion Bank staff to perform banking operations.
                    <h5 class="project-point">Internet banking website</h5>
                    Online banking system providing banking services to customers.
                    <h5 class="project-point">Mobile banking app</h5>
                    Make banking services more accessible to customers. Due to the constraints of the project, we planned to develop a responsive banking website first instead of making an real app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also developed an external system to simulate the system's communication process with external parties (for example, overseas transactions).

                    Due to security constraints we were not able to use contextual inquiry to really experience and learn from real banking activities. As an alternative, we approached some banking professionals - both staff and system engineers from banks which were not our direct competitors, to learn about their business processes.

                    We wrote many scenarios in our report to explain the detailed processes. I know there are a lot of words! If given a second chance, I would probably be drawing more flow diagrams and adding details to the diagram. That would make it much easier to communicate the ideas to the whole team.

                    Account activation, initial password change, account lock out, secure password reset, Captcha mechanism and 2nd Factor Authentication are implemented in an appropriate way to secure the system.
                    <h5 class="project-point">Access control</h5>
                    A robust role-based and need-based access control mechanism for controlling user’s access to various resources in the system. User with multiple roles can easily but securely access all the resources needed while having a clear idea of the current role.
                    <h5 class="project-point">Cryptographic techniques</h5>
                    The system uses encryption and hashing to protect sensitive information, such as login password.

                    Automatic session inactivity logout to prevent account hijacking on the system.

The colours adopted for both the company logo we designed and our overall layout are dark blue and golden yellow, which radiate loyalty and wisdom, as well as affluence and success.

                    <strong>I improved a lot on my leadership skills through this project. </strong>
                    I want to thank my awesome teammates who supported me along the way and also gave suggestions about how to be a better leader.                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Communication is extremely important in an agile environment. </strong>
                    We benefited a lot from being in the same room, having daily standup meetings and constantly adjusting our goals to finish such a huge project on time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>This project aroused my interest in UX design. </strong>
                    I clearly remember that I enjoyed playing around the components in the page and arranging them in a way that would largely increase the staff productivity. I also explored how the arrangement of buttons can also make a huge impact on productivity. Hosting team design activities was also an interesting experience to me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>UX design should be everywhere in the project.</strong>
                    Reflecting upon the project, we have a lot to improve on. For example, our system design report was very lengthy and full of texts, which was not user-friendly at all especially if the report was meant to be read by the engineers. Moreover, instead of mainly sticking our design to current practices, we could have more innovations based on the problems and needs we identified. Although UX was not the focus of this project, I realized that UX is the way to make Merlion Bank stand out in the Singapore's highly competitive market.
