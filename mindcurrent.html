                  Last summer, I interned as a UX designer in Mindcurrent for around four months.
                  Mindcurrent was developing an industry-first B2B mobile app that predicts performance and reduces stress of employees using AI technologies.
                  This project demonstrates part of my work where I collaborated with another UX designer, the leadership team and data scientists to design mobile screens that show visualization and insights about personal stress pattern.

                  After getting my assigned task, I decided to spend some time figuring out the detailed product concept first to make sure that my design aligns with the company's initial idea and is on the expected direction.

                      World Health Organization has declared stress to be the “health epidemic of the 21st century”. Employee stress is costly.
                      <h5 class="project-point">Stress is personal. </h5>
                      People are stressed about different things. Although their stress affects their work, it's not all caused by the work.
                      <h5 class="project-point">COVID brings even more stress.</h5>
                      Worrying about job and financial situations, working remotely, dealing with more relationship issues at home all bring even more stress to employees, and also more challenges for teams to work together efficiently.

                    Mindcurrent provides unique values to employees and their teams by recording and predicting stress patterns, and providing personalised suggestions to help them reduce stress and perform better in their daily life.

                  <p>
                    My task was to design the "Trends" page of the app, which shows both the data record and AI predictions of people's stress patterns, and also serves as a place that connects to all other important features of the app.
                    Breaking down my task, it includes the following design goals:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="project-list">
                    <li class="mt10">
                      Designing the visualization of personal stress pattern and any related insights
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt10">
                      Encouraging users to take personalized suggested actions to reduce their stress
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt10">
                      Encouraging users to record their stress level frequently in order for the app to provide more accurate results
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section-small">

                  <h4 class="project-step-title">Things I took into consideration</h4>
                  <p class="mt40">
                    <h5 class="project-point">Balancing needs of customers vs users</h5>
                    While customers, who are usually managers, want to get more insights about employee stress and performance, employees as end users care most about if this app has enough privacy and transparency while helping themselves personally.

                    <h5 class="project-point">Earning trust as a AI product</h5>
                    AI product can be personalized and caring, but it can also be creepy, especially when data is extracted from the user. To make sure that our users enjoy benefits of the app at ease, I stick to some principles when designing the product:
                    <ul class="project-list">
                      <li>
                        <b>Privacy: </b>user consent about what, how and where the data is used is extremely important, especially because the product is going to share data within the team. And users should always have control over the use of data. <br>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Transparency & explainability: </b>the visualization that I design should visualize all the data we collect from users and help them understand how we analyze the data and generate personalized suggestions based on that.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="project-stage-title">Understanding the users</h2>
                <p>
                  After understanding my design goals and challenges, I discussed with the management and marketing teams to learn more about the specific types of people that we are designing for.

                  <h4 class="project-step-title">Customer persona</h4>
                  <p>
                    Based on our discussion, we came to the conclusion that managers with certain personalities are more likely to purchase our product. I summarized that in a persona to make sure that the design would meet the needs of our target customers and help us attract some beta customers.

                  <p>
                    Although we don't want to have too much definition of the users and hope that as many people as possible can use this product, we still want to summarize their needs, hesitations, and some basic commonalities to make sure that some people in the organization would be willing to adopt this product.

                    Understanding the use cases is important for me to envision how the users are going to use the screens that I design.
                    Given that the company has limited user research on the detailed use cases, I made some assumptions that users are more likely to view their stress patterns at the beginning and end of the day to either prepare for the day or reflect on themselves.
                    This simple flow diagram shows the use case when user receives a notification asking how she/he is feeling.

                  <p>
                    My first attempt was to redesign the "Trends" screen for stress patterns based on the existing design of the company.
                    Since it's a new concept, I spent a lot of time understanding the product idea to make sure that I include all the details in my redesign.
                    I use annotations to show some of the thought process behind my design.

                  <h4 class="project-step-title">From insights to actions</h4>
                  <p>
                    Considering that the app provides value to users by suggesting personalized actions for them to take to reduce their stress, the goal of this design iteration was to make users more likely to take the suggested actions after viewing their stress pattern and insights.

                  <h4 class="project-step-title">Clearer CTA</h4>
                  <p>
                    We received feedback that people may be confused about what actions they should take on this screen,
                    and the cognitive workload is too heavy for the users if they need to choose from multiple options.
                    So the goal of this iteration was to focus users attention on a single action to get them started.

                  <p>
                    Since this app provides personalized suggestions to users,
                    user input is extremely important for the app to provide more accurate results.
                    Therefore, another goal of this screen is to encourage users to record their stress level frequently.
                    However, we also need to balance that with the values we provide to the users.

                    Although we are selling the product to customers, I realized that we should put as less burden as possible on customer's shoulder to onboard users and motivate users to use the product. Therefore, I also collaborated with a few other UX designers in the company to brainstorm ideas on how to onboard users in the app.

                    <strong>User adoption is the key: </strong>it is a key to the long-term success of a B2B product, and sometimes it's my responsibility as a UX designer to advocate for the end users.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Solving the real problems: </strong>even though we use AI technologies, we are not selling AI. The most important thing is still how to solve people's problems and bring more values to them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Importance of alignment: </strong>although speed is important, some design processes are still necessary. Getting alignment on product positioning, the goals, customers/users needs, and any underlying principles to follow would make the work more efficient.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>More communication with the tech team: </strong>I wish we could have more direct communication with the tech team to efficiently discuss about feasibility of some proposed solutions, and also answer their questions about design details, as we were not designing for every detailed use case and state.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>More feedback from the users: </strong>since the product has not launched during my internship, we used a very lean approach to design. Although we managed to do some usability tests with friends and family, and hear potential customer's feedback from the management team, I wish we had the chance to conduct user testing ourselves and collect more feedback from real users.
